title: Utils

Archimedes has baked in some utils that are usually needed in most projects:

- Maybe
- Datetime
- HttpClient
- Observer
- Extended Error
- Is Promise
- Types
  - Class

## Installation

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{ label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
{ label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
]}
>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    ```bash
    npm i @archimedes/utils -SE
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

    ```bash
    yarn add @archimedes/utils -E
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Maybe

This is a monad that improves `null` and `undefined` handling. It implements the [null object pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/null_object). It's best used with deep nullable and optional object structures, in other cases you might be better off with using the [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator) and [optional chaining operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining).

You can create a Maybe like so:

```typescript
Maybe.from(42)
```

When you use a Maybe in order to access a value you have to use the method `getOrElse`:

```typescript
const maybe = Maybe.from(42)
maybe.getOrElse(0)
```

This is best used with objects:

```typescript
type Type = { foo: Maybe<{ bar: string }> }
const maybeMap = Maybe.from<Type>({ foo: Maybe.from({ bar: 'qux' }) })
expect(maybeMap.flatMap(x => x.foo).map(x => x.bar)).toEqual(Maybe.from('qux'))
```

You can use the `map` method to map an existing value to another one. If the Maybe doesn't have a value then the map is not called. If you want to unwrap a Maybe inside a Maybe you can use the `flatMap` method.

## Datetime

This utility improves Date handling. Every date you create is in UTC timezone.

## HttpClient

A simple [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) wrapper that has improved TypeScript support, middlewares and overall a simpler API than fetch.

```typescript
const httpClient = HttpClient.create({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080' })
httpClient.get('/users')
```

## Observer

This interface allows you to implement the [Observer pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer).

## Extended error

Small utility to extend from when creating [custom errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#custom_error_types) in order to maintain proper stack trace for where our error was thrown (only available in V8):

```ts
export class CustomError extends ExtendedError {
  constructor() {
    super('This is a custom error')
  }
}
```
